Fountain friendly to a degree.,"I bought a pack of four of these at a discount price of £2.00 each at that price they are superb value. I see the price is usually around £7.50. I would never buy one of these at that price they are just not that good.What I like: The paper is of a good weight at 100GSM. And the paper has a robust feel to it, a nice stiffness, but not as stiff as some quality 80GSM papers.The lines are feint. And the notebook overall feels robust enough.Fountain pen inks (and I have tried a few in it) do not bleed of feather. They also shade fairly well, but not the best. There is no bleed through whatsoever.The paper is off white but still shows the true fountain pen ink colour.Things I do not like:My pens have all had work done on the nibs to reduce feedback and some are very polished and smooth on the paper indeed. With those nibs that write with a glassy smoothness I get a feeling of friction with this paper and a rather delightful yet loud pen on paper sound. Wish my nibs that have slight feedback I get much more feedback. I think if a feed-backy nib or one that is prone to being a little scratchy  were used on this paper it would not be a pleasant experience at all. THIS IS NOT PREMIUM PAPER, but it's OK'ishThe PVC cover - We need to get away from plastics and a card or craft paper cover would feels so much nicer in the hand.The notebook has square, not rounded corners and I expect these will suffer curling in due course.The paper is not designated as being from environmentally manged sources.The pages are not perforated.Overall I would not pay any more that £2.00 ea. as there is a famous brand of best quality A5 pads with with premium paper, superior to these, at £2.00 ea if bought as a pack of 20.  Were it not for these I would pay a pound or two more for a different quality brand.These are what I might call good quality school pads and I use school in the English sense, I would want better at university.CRITICALLY THEY ARE NOT MARKED AS ACID FREE PAPER. so I would not use one for notes I would want to keep for a long time.",Positive,0,1,0,discount price superb value good weight nice stiffness quality 80gsm papers.the lines notebook overall robust enough.fountain pen inks whatsoever.the paper true fountain pen ink colour.things glassy smoothness loud pen slight

These are not as bulky and don't take up a lot of room in a bookbag. They also come with sticky page markers you can write on which is a nice touch. So still even if you want a notebook that has several subject in one you can add a page marker to make it into one. The pages are high quality paper and include a date section at the top of the page. Overall, best notebook I have bought yet I would recommend buying these. Also the price is very reasonable for the quality you get.The only thing I would change would be to make the covers a little more durable. They still hold up well and aren't flimsy but if I had to pick one thing to improve that would be it. They are a bendable plastic cover and I would change this to either a non bendable plastic or to a sturdy cardboard.

The shipping packaging was excellent, so I'm left with no other guess but that it was a damaged item that got through QC somehow. In my world, artist papers need to be in excellent condition - folds, bends, tears: no patron will want a sketch or painting with those characteristics. So the only option I'm left with is to trim off about an inch on one end, which kind of p*sses me off because I tend to work with a few specific sizes.

The smell is herbal -- minty and eucalyptus-like. Doesn't lather all that much but we all know lathering doesn't do anything -- it's just an ingredient added to make consumers feel they're ""cleaning.""I bought this for my senior dog, who was suffering from severe skin rashes, yeast buildup and sores. He was allergic to grass -- I say ""was"" because just weeks later I had to put him down :(  This shampoo helped make his last weeks more comfortable. Immediately following each bath, I noticed a significant reduction in scratching and paw-licking. Unfortunately his health had deteriorated so badly, nothing could've really saved him but at least this provided some relief.I would recommend this product for dogs with sensitive skin and/or allergies. There are lots of strong chemicals out it's not really a far stretch to imagine some of these chemicals might have adverse effects on dogs -- especially smaller ones considering their weight relative to the concentration of pesticides, etc. My old dog's paws would flare up especially after a round of grass treatment outside my apartment.I have used other brands of shampoo and I can say this is one of the best out there. I used harsher shampoos that promised to wipe out dermatitis but I always felt a little bad putting my dog through such treatments. This brand of shampoo is more gentle, but equally effective. Dog smells much better after a wash, without that artificial smell you get from commercial shampoos.Product arrived in a timely fashion. Nicely packaged.

No, really, I do! The last batch I bought I went with some lavender-scented, possibly biodegradable poo bags (their website was vague on that) and I didn't realize how much I hated them until I got these! Let's pretend that lavender-scented poop is better than regular-scented poop for a minute (it's not!). Those ornery bags wouldn't tear off without a struggle either! These lovely bags have a cut in the center to hook on the dispenser tab (that comes with them), which makes them SO much easier to tear apart, Gorilla dispenser or not. I put them in my other dispenser, too, for the other leash and they tear off just fine in the standard dispenser. No more standing outside while the mosquitos are making a meal out of me fiddling with those stubborn bags! And if you think the tearing off is the hard part, you've got another thing comin' when you try to open the dern things! I don't know what it is about the material those lavender ones are made of that makes them so hard to open but I left a review for those too if you'd like to check it out. I started getting a sore throat from licking my fingers to unfold one, then licking again (sometimes more than once) to open it. I'm thinking it was the lavender scented stuff on them, I can't be sure, but when I made a point to stop doing that I stopped getting sore throats. (Coincidence?) These bags unfold and open MUCH more easily so that hasn't been an issue since I got these.Okay, let's talk price. I paid $11.99 for 270 lavender-scented bags. That comes out to 4.4 cents per bag ($.044). I paid $14.99 for 1000 of these Gorilla bags (they seem to be on sale now but they weren't then) which comes out to be 1.4 cents per bag ($.014). Not only are these bags a thousand times better, they're cheaper, too! Why in the world did I pay 3x more for crappier bags? (pardon the pun) These Gorilla bags come 20 to a roll, too, so I'm not constantly having to change the roll like I did with the other brand, which only has 15 bags per roll. Why, you ask, are there only 15 of the other brand on the roll? Those are one inch longer, 9x13, while these are 9x12. My little guy is only 35 lbs so I could do with a sandwich bag size and even these are total overkill but I can't imagine anyone would need THAT much room to tie a knot. Even so, at this price (what I paid, $14.99), you could use three EVERY time and still come out ahead of the other brand! (For the nerds about to click on their calculators, no need, I've already done the math for you! 3.14 times. You're welcome!)In summation (because I'm fancy like that), these bags are easier to rip off the roll, easier to unfold, easier to open, cost less, and require less frequent refilling of the rolls. I haven't found a defective one yet, nor one that tore open (in fairness, of either brand). They seem equally sturdy and while neither brand keeps the stink in very well, I will note that these keep the stink in at least as well as the other brand, if not better. I learned something about myself through this experience, I prefer poo that isn't lavender-scented. When I'm not near a doggy station I bring the poo bag inside, dump the contents in the toilet, tie the top of the bag, and put it in my kitchen trash receptacle (it has a covered lid). While I often had to take the trash out before the bag was full before just to get rid of the stink, I haven't so much as THOUGHT about it since I got these. If you're wondering if I just don't like the smell of lavender, I'd like to mention that I have three essential diffusers and about 60 essential oils, and I buy lavender both in dried form and essential oil in bulk. (You can check out my diffusers, dried lavender, and essential oil reviews by clicking on my name.) I'm going to buy these bags as long as I need bags, the search is over!",Positive,0,1,0,love biodegradable poo bags 's pretend ornery bags n't tear lovely bags dispenser tab so gorilla standard dispenser stubborn bags hard part thing comin dern things lavender ones sore throat

Our dog wouldn’t touch it for several days (made us feel awful), however he eventually ate some, then a little more and now it is mainstay. He developed a dreadful yeast infection some years ago and the Vet suggested ‘medication and costly shampoos for life’. We suspected food may have contributed to the severity of the infection ( not caused it but certainly exacerbated it). He was, at that time, eating a very high quality dry food with extremely impressive ingredients. But we knew something in the ingredients was a potential cause. We searched to find a food with single protein sauce and very little else. It is surprisingly difficult to find such a food. Most of the foods marketed as such were usually full of potatoes or rice or lots of vegetables and fruits - which sounded very healthy - but not what was needed. We did not want chicken- based protein as even chicken is a potential risk for yeast infections. We found ziwi peak venison - it was worrryingly expensive, I must admit. However the infection has improved immensely and his arthritis seems to be steadier than it was ( again all we got from the vet was a ‘pills for life’ assessment for his arthritis.

24880,24880,Pet Supplies,Litter Genie Plus Pail Silver_DX,5,27-Jul-23,United States,48.32,Amazing,"I was skeptical of how much I would really like this at first. Before litter genie I was just using a little step trash can with a grocery bag liner inside. But the litter genie is worlds above that kind of system. I’m sensitive to smells. Especially bad smells. So it was important to me to have something that I could toss the doodoo into that would keep the smell in, even when I opened it again to put more doodoo in.The system in genius. You scoop the turd, place it on the trap after you open the lid, pull the trap out to let the turd fall and then close the trap again. It takes mere seconds. You can do it fast enough that you won’t even smell anything. I let the turd bag fill up for about 2-3 weeks. I FOR SURE expected mold or something to be growing in the bag after so long. But alas, nothing! The bag wasn’t even steamy looking. I was BEYOND surprised. And there was probably a good 2 pounds of poop in the bag! So much doodoo and no mold, no smell, no steaminess, nothing? Crazy!Upon taking the poop bag out to throw away, all you do is pull a really good amount of the top of the bag where you would tie it, there’s a little bag cutter on the inside of the litter genie when you pop it open, slide the bag through the cutter, all the while keeping the top of the bag closed tight, and like a balloon just tie a knot. No smell, no unpleasantness, no hassle, no grossness, it felt completely sanitary. I didn’t feel gross afterwards like I normally do tying a poopy grocery bag.I keep the litter genie right next to the litter box so when I see a turd I can just drop it in right there. This system has brought me a world of convenience I didn’t even know I could have. If you have a cat, if your neighbor has a cat, if your friend has a cat, if your family member has a cat, GET A LITTER GENIE!!!",Positive,0,1,0,litter genie step trash grocery bag liner litter genie ’ m especially bad smells doodoo in.the system turd fall mere seconds ’ t turd bag for sure bag wasn ’
24881,24881,Pet Supplies,Litter Genie Plus Pail Silver_DX,5,13-Dec-19,United States,48.32,A miracle!,"Honestly I LOVE this Litter Genie. I have owned cats most of my life and for the past several years I only had outdoor barn cats because I did NOT want to deal with litter smell again. I detest the smell of cat poop and urine with the mixed floral or detergent scent of litter. Gross. So, when my young daughter convinced my husband that we needed to keep a runt kitten indoors that mama cat stopped feeding I relented and searched thoroughly for litter pans and trash cans (I usually use the foot pedal trash cans and stick a scent stick up under lid but this was NOT working well as every time you open lid you get a wonderful waft of cat stink that just seems to suspend forever in the air). I have always been used to the front swing door litter pans but found a top loader that was interesting. Bought that then suddenly stumbled onto the litter genie! After reading countless reviews and learning about the different bag options and best way to use the litter genie I ended up purchasing. $10 was incredibly reasonable and I figured if it sucked I would just be out ten bucks.Fast forward over a week and there is ZERO litter smell. It is amazing. I scoop daily into the litter genie (sometimes a few times a day if my daughter does it too), pull the handle and swoosh the grossness is dropped out of sight. I use Fresh Step litter which I have found clumps a hundred times better than others. My kitten is small and her poops are small so I could have waited to empty the genie over a week but I just emptied the bag today and it was so easy. I did as the others recommended and used a zip tie instead of tying. It really saves the bag space a lot. Using the cutter was simple and there was no litter leakage. The button to open the bottom of the Plus Litter Genie lined up and I had no issues. It was so simple and thoroughly contained. Every so often I spray the lid and top area with some Lysol but its for my own desire not that it really needs it. The hole on top is big enough for the poop and pee clumps. I did not use the litter scoop that came with it as it did appear a bit large holed and cheap but the other one I bought fits perfectly in the holder. I also bought sanitizing wipes to wipe down the genie if it gets soiled.So far I am totally amazed and impressed. As I said, I have tons of experience with cats and kitty litter so this isn't my first rodeo. I could have used this thing YEARS ago! I will update if I have any issues but so far I like it a lot. I bought some 50count vanilla scented bags from walmart for super cheap so will try those in the genie once the ring empties to try to make more affordable bag purchase.Oh btw I bought the IRIS Top Entry Cat Litter Box with Cat Litter Scoop and am loving that too. No bags, deep litter method and I have had no poo tracks and extremely little litter pebbles on the floor.",Positive,0,1,0,honestly love litter genie outdoor barn cats not cat poop detergent scent gross young daughter runt kitten indoors mama cat litter pans trash cans foot pedal trash cans not open

Used crystal litter and replaced it every 3 - 7 days.Worked fine until we moved into a small house by ourselves where the only really option for the litter box was in the laundry that's right next to the kitchen. Much more noticeable as you'd imagine. Looked into options, bought the litter genie and it worked pretty well. It extended the life of the litter but because our cat pees a ton (post operation, he had bladder stones), it was impossible to separate the dirty from the clean. Changed to clumping litter recently and combined with the litter genie, you wouldn't even think we have a cat. Scoop twice a day and empty this thing roughly once a week (10 days maybe) and our house has no smell at all.

Here's why I highly recommend this scratching post:1. Durable and Sturdy Construction:The first thing that caught my eye was the solid construction of this scratching post. It's clear that the materials used are of high quality, and the post is sturdy enough to withstand the enthusiastic scratching of my cat. Unlike some other scratching posts I've tried in the past, this one doesn't wobble or tip over during use. My cats love to climb up the tree as well and have put this to their ultimate test.2. Irresistible Design for Cats:The design of the scratching post is not only functional but also cat-friendly. The sisal rope covering provides the perfect texture for scratching, satisfying my cat's natural instinct to scratch and stretch. The height is just right, allowing my cat to fully extend her body, promoting healthy exercise and reducing the risk of furniture damage.3. Stylish Addition to Home Decor:I appreciate that this scratching post is not only practical but also aesthetically pleasing. The palm tree look is a fun design to have around and a great conversation piece. It's a win-win – my cat gets a dedicated space to scratch, and I get a piece that enhances the overall look of my living space.4. Easy Assembly and Stability:Setting up the scratching post was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and all the necessary tools were provided. Within minutes, my cat was already investigating her new favorite spot. The base is wide and stable, ensuring that the post stays in place even during vigorous scratching sessions.5. Cat's Seal of Approval:Most importantly, my cat absolutely loves it! She took to the scratching post immediately, and it has become her go-to spot for stretching, scratching, and play. It's a relief to see her happy and engaged without resorting to damaging my furniture.In conclusion, the Scratching Post is a fantastic investment for cat owners looking to provide their feline friends with a healthy outlet for their natural instincts. With its durable construction, attractive design, and cat-approved features, it's a purr-fect addition to any cat-friendly household.

I have a toy Aussie about 10 lbs and a lab mix about 45 lbs.

I had a teething toy Aussie and a full grown lab mix. So I had to keep my lab mix away from these bones with his adult teeth, otherwise he immediately would chew them into pieces and ended up vomiting them up later. All in all, they worked great for my puppy at the time, but I ended up not using them to prevent anything from happening to my lab.With that said, I still definitely recommend if you have a smaller puppy who is teething or a smaller dog who is a gentle chewer!

For example, you won't have to go back and change gross income if you put more rental income from a rental house, or add another 1099 or W-2.  And you won't have to change the tax due or refund due if you toss in some more deductions on Schedule A.Of course, the end result is a very professional package of tax return (mine sometimes runs more than 100 pages --- I'm into everything the IRS wants to know about!) and Intuit will send it in electronically for free!If you live in a state that has state income tax, this Premium version and probably a few others includes at least one state tax return.

It’s a healthier alternative to plastic cups, eliminating the worry about potential additives. This feature alone gives me peace of mind knowing that my boys are drinking from a safe and non-toxic container.Cleaning these cups is a breeze, which is a huge plus for any parent. They hold up wonderfully, even with daily use, and still look as good as new. The variety of colors they come in is another bonus. My boys love their vibrant and fun cups!Despite being a bit pricey, these cups are a worthwhile investment. They are built to last, and considering their superior quality and functionality, I believe they offer good value for money.What’s more, they keep the kids’ water cold all day, which is perfect for those hot summer days or long school hours.In conclusion, if you’re looking for a durable, easy-to-clean, and safe drinking cup for your kids, I highly recommend the Hydro Flask Kids Wide Mouth Straw Cap And Boot.

If your main concerns are oral motor development and you are willing to spend a little bit more time cleaning the lid and you are okay with a leaded sealing dot under the bottom metal cap, the Klean Kanteen TK Wide straw bottle is the way to go. The Thermos Funtainer is a good less expensive bottle for oral motor development but it also has a leaded sealing dot under the plastic bottom boot. If you want the most durable kids bottle possible and are okay with a leaded sealing dot under the metal bottom cap, the Yeti is the top contender. Just keep in mind that while the Yeti may look fairly easier to clean, the lid has a bunch of crevices that are very difficult to clean. It wouldn’t surprise me if over them, mold grew under part of the cap that you can’t access to clean with the Yeti. If you want to a completely plastic free bottle, the Pura Kiki straw bottle is the way to go. All new Pura Kiki bottles should be lead free for their sealing dot. They also sell single walled bottles.Lead explanation - Most insulated stainless steel water bottles sold in the US use a leaded sealing dot to vacuum seal their bottles. It doesn’t touch the inside of the bottle. Instead it is on the outside. Since it is illegal for kids products to contain more than 90 ppm in accessible components, water bottles marketed to kids with a leaded sealing dot will often have a bumper or sticker on the bottom that isn’t supposed to come oxff. Kleen Kanteen and Yeti both seem to have extremely durable bottom caps that rarely come off. However, it would be ideal if more companies would use lead free sealing dots like Hydroflask started doing post 2018. When buying other insulated stainless steel brands, be mindful that adult bottles only usually cover the leaded sealing dot with paint that can wear off. Children might use these bottles and be exposed to lead. Single layer non insulated stainless steel bottles (such as Kleen Kanteen) are not a concern because they do not use a sealing dot.Additional comments: The dew color hydroflask spout is sharper around the edges than the lake color. I ordered a replacement because I thought it was a defect but the replacement was no better. I also wish that the Hydroflask came with a stainless steel or medical grade silicone straw so that plastic is not constantly touching the water.Pictures: Yeti, Hydroflask, and Klean Kanteen caps from left to rightYeti lead free sealing dot vs Yeti metal boot that covers the leaded sealing dot for the adult 26 oz bottleLast photo: 2 adult bottles - purple Kleen Kanteen single wall non insulated bottle that has no lead because it doesn’t require a sealing dot vs pink Camelbak insulated bottle with leaded sealing dot covered by a thin layer or paintAn ideal bottle would combine the Klean Kanteen straw lid with an insulated lead free bottle base.

25677,25677,Sporting Goods,Thule Chasm Sport Duffel Bag,5,4-Dec-23,United States,222.85,The 130 liter Thule Chasm duffel is sturdy and BIG with multiple carry options,"I bought the 130 liter Thule Chasm duffel as my main piece of luggage for a 4 week trip involving car travel, hotel stays, cruise ships, and a train.  I needed clothing and some equipment for two very different climates, so I wanted a big piece of luggage that fit within airline dimensions but was sturdy and flexible and which could be put on wheels when necessary.  The Thule Chasm 130L is 34"" x 18"" x 16.5"", a total linear dimensional measurement of 68.5"" which is over the airlines 62"" dimensional limits if fully packed and expanded.  However, if not packed to bursting, the bag's compression straps can be used to reduce the dimensions to what the airlines will accept.  If airline limits aren't applicable, this bag easily can be packed in excess of both the size and 50# weight limits, yet is still manageable.The bag has multiple carry options, with optional backpack straps, a top carry handle, and grab handles on both ends.  This made moving the bag around fairly easy, despite its large size.  I wouldn't recommend carrying it long distances when packed full with clothing, however - it doesn't take the place of a decent backpack for hiking.  Its weight when packed also makes it less than idea for long carry with the handles.  I brought a collapsible two-wheeled aluminum handtruck with me that I could carry into the airline cabin after checking the bag.  (Wheeled bags reduce the net luggage weight since the wheels are included in the airlines weight measurement.)  I could place this duffel vertically on the handtruck and still have room for another smaller duffel to sit horizontally on top, all strapped in place to prevent shifting.The internal mesh pockets are useful for some internal organization, and the external pocket at one end provides storage for items to be accessed quickly without opening the entire bag.  There isn't any internal organization for the main compartment; I use ""packing cubes"" (Amazon Basics ones work fine) to keep my clothing organized.Overall it is a great bag assuming you need this much storage space.  It is an extremely big bag, and it holds a lot.  Just the ticket if you have a lot to transport and need to keep your bag count down, but is overkill if you don't.  One way to think of it is as the modern equivalent of a steamer trunk.",Neutral,1,0,0,thule chasm main piece week trip car travel hotel stays cruise ships different climates big piece airline dimensions thule chasm total linear dimensional measurement dimensional limits bag 's compression straps

However, the challenge I have with it (and the same problem with the North Face Base Camp duffel) is the ""shoulder straps"" for carrying on the back.  Both Patagonia and North Face have a complex tie/buckle system that is NOT easy to remove and store, especially when your at the airport checking or picking up bag.  the Thule Chasm fixing this big problem with a very easy and incredible simple clip. It takes a few seconds vs. the Patagonia/North Face that is frustrating and difficult to manage.  The Thule duffel also has the largest opening to easy access clothes/gear.  The material is as tough as North Face's duffel.  Thule also added other tech like snaps to hold bag the handles when you carry bag on your back or a convenient pocket on the outside that enables you to store a copy of your travel documents.  It's by far the best duffel I've used.  Highly recommend you look at Thule over the others.  AND if you need a larger duffel it's one of the largest at 130L.  Patagonia only sells one 100L.

25695,25695,Sporting Goods,,1,18-Feb-24,Singapore,,,"The Fitbit Inspire 3 has been a big disappoinment and is quite misleading. I anticipated the most expensive ""top-tier"" fitness tracker, especially since it's made by Google. However, its quality falls far below that of other fitness bands. It really shocked me. I thought I received a defective product. I was looking to upgrade from my Garmin Vivosmart 4, assuming that since the Inspire 3 was released in September 2022, it would surpass the Vivosmart 4, which came out in September 2018, 4 years difference.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Here's why:1. The display is disappointingly small. Despite claims about the ""screen area,"" the actual display is only about 50% of what you'd expect. See the attached photo. Initially, I thought it was a defective screen, as I've never encountered a display with such limited visibility. It's even smaller than the Vivosmart 4's display.2. Navigation is cumbersome due to the tiny display and smooth scrolling. Unlike the Vivosmart, which displays information per page when swiped, the Inspire 3's smooth scrolling makes it difficult to navigate.3. The SpO2 feature only functions during sleep at night; on Vivosmart, I can measure my SpO2 anytime when I need it.4. There's no Vo2Max feature, and the skin temperature monitoring only operates at night.5. The $10 monthly subscription fee may explain why the app feels basic in functionality.6. This band requires constant wear for many of its features to work properly. If you don't wear it 24/7, you'll miss out on many readings.Considering its limitations, this band shouldn't cost more than $50.

25723,25723,Sporting Goods,RTP ShockSorb Ultrasoft Worlds' Best Tennis Racquet Vibration Dampeners,5,27-Aug-19,United States,36.05,Works as advertised (with some caveat),"TL/DR: Get this dampener right now if you suffer from tennis elbow!!![I usually don't write reviews unless the product sucks and want to warn other potential buyers, but this product has prompted me to write my very first, extensive (and glowing) review of an Amazon purchase. Yeah, this dampener is that good.]I bought this about a week ago and have used it almost daily, and I must say, they may be right in their claim that this is the ""World's best (tennis string) dampener"". It certainly works far better than the usual rubber dampeners, but with some caveats which I'll go into in a bit.But first, a bit about me so you can have a better sense of the dampener's effectiveness. I'm a baseliner that hits with a lot of pace and top spin that's 4.5-equivalent (NTRP), and I use custom-weighted Head Graphene Radical MP with full co-poly string job in the 40s. I stopped playing competitively a while back due to tennis elbow that just won't go away and will flare up after a couple hours of hard hitting, which consequently has limited my playing frequency to twice a week tops (used to play 4-5 times a week before the elbow).To its credit, RTP ShockSorb has all but prevented elbow flare-ups, to such level that I played 3 days in a row without having to put my arm in a sling. Heck, I didn't even have to ice my elbow or take ibuprofen. This is pretty darn amazing, and I am utterly impressed in its efficacy (yes, I'm likening it to a medicine because it's that good!).The RTP ShockSorb, compared to my usual dampener (round Head 'Djokovic' dampener), mutes the string vibration greatly. I don't have any measurement tools, but the seat-of-the-pants is at lest double--maybe even triple--the dampening. It also feels as if the sweetspot is enlarged even though the dampener is mounted on only two center mains. It's not quite as enlarged as 'the worm', but I prefer RTP ShockSorb because, while the level of dampening is similar to 'the worm', you still get just enough feedback on slightly-off-center shots to know how cleanly you're hitting. This is also very evident when you're volleying. One other benefit over 'the worm' is that it won't pops and leak the gel all over your hands and outfit.The core of RTP ShockSorb is soft, almost putty-like, which I'm guessing is what makes it so effective in its dampening ability. Unfortunately, this softness may also be its biggest shortcoming from the durability perspective. Due to the core's soft/sticky nature, it will likely get squished unless you're very careful when installing it, and then once it's on the strings it doesn't want to slide which makes it difficult to move it to the 'proper' posiition. And in my week's usage, I've installed one RTP ShockSorb between several different racquets to test its effectiveness on different string setups, and each time I install/uninstall it, the part of the core that makes contact with the strings looks increasingly worn & torn. This 'wear' is a lot worse when you install/uninstall it on shaped strings, and this is a fairly big concern because my mains are shaped and I cut out my strings every 2-3 weeks.Another concern regarding the soft core is whether it's affected by extreme temperatures and if so, how much. I play mostly indoors, so my playing temperature is relatively steady, but those of you playing in super-hot summer weather (or cold winters later in the year) might have varying experiences (or not).The other caveat is the weight. This dampener is heavy (for a dampener). At least twice as heavy (probably heavier in actuality) as my Head dampener. It's heavy enough that it throws off the racquet's balance when it's installed in the 'normal' dampener install point (pushed up flush against the bottom cross). My sticks are customized to be very head-light because my swing is fast and whippy/wristy, so on the first few days I was struggling with timing because it made the stick less head-light (on a different stock Head racquet with even balance, it actually felt like it became head-heavy). I was struggling to correct the balance with lead tapes but wasn't very successful, and it was frustrating me to the point that I came THIS close to returning it.Then I got an idea one day to push RTP ShockSorb all the way down so it's flush with the neck, and this made the balance less affected and made it easier to re-balance the racquet to the correct balance. So my solution to the added weight: intall it at the bottom of the main strings. The secondary implication here is that, if you're like me and are very sensitive to the racquet's balance, buying and using RTP ShockSorb means you have to make a real commitment because you'll have to re-balance your racquet (and if you lose it in the middle of a match, you can't just sub it with a normal rubber dampener that weighs next to nothing).So to sum it up:1) this thing absorbs string vibration like nothing else on the market2) durability of the soft core is suspect3) added weight may likely throw off your racquet's balanceDespite the caveats, this is a super product for suffers of tennis elbow (or wrist, or shoulder). At $15 a pop, I think it takes the crown as the most expensive dampener on the market, but with many high-end strings going for $20+ per pack, I think it's a very worthy investment, especially considering that I get to keep my racquets and not spend time and money on newer models that boast enhanced dampening (which may or may not be true, or may have other caveats like playability for your particular style of tennis). Durability, we'll just have to see.So all in all, big kudos for the team behind this Kickstarter project!Get it if you are elbow/wrist sufferer!",Positive,0,1,0,tl/dr tennis elbow product sucks potential buyers amazon yeah world 's tennis string usual rubber dampeners dampener 's effectiveness 's 4.5-equivalent ntrp head graphene radical mp string job tennis elbow

25757,25757,Sporting Goods,"Thermos 24 Ounce Tritan Hydration Bottle with Meter, Teal",5,9-Feb-14,United States,18.88,another solid quality liquid container by Thermos,"I bought this because being a regular gym goer, I must intake a good amount of water throughout the day. In addition, by being in the military, I am encouraged to stay hydrated at all times. This bottle is the perfect tool to enable me to accomplish that goal. Also, I was fed up with buying and throwing away so many relatively expensive 1 liter ""sport"" designed bottled water bottles. I wanted to save money and my trashcan buy purchasing the cumbersome, albeit less expensive 1.5 liter bottles (hey I'm trying, environmentalists). I would've gone with the 5 gallon jug, but it is just too impractical to pour and it doesn't fit inside my fridge (or my trashcan).Design: This is a tall and slender bottle made of BPA-free plastic, with a fairly solid loop for attaching it to things (and vice versa), which fits in with many other styles on the market. For grip, it has a wide textured surface running down one side, which also curves slightly inward, allowing a more comfortable hold for smaller hands. On the reverse, it has a dual measurement scale in liters and fluid ounces. The liters scale goes from 0.1L by every 100 milliliters up to 0.6L, while the fluid ounces is scaled from 4oz by every 4 ounces to 20oz, although it can hold 24 ounces. The look is very interesting and unique, as far as plastic water bottles go.Performance: Well, I have very large hands and it is indeed comfortable to grip. I assume that the textured side is where the fingers wrap around to, but in any case, you can have it on either side, depending on how you twist the cap onto the bottle. Now onto the cap, which is this bottle's bread and butter. It twists off with ease, opening the way to the wide mouthed opening of the base, which allows for easy pouring into and for dropping in large solid objects, like ice. It has a silicon seal inside, so it stays put with no leaks when you twist it back on. The mechanism for drinking is by way of a large thumb button on the front and a flip-top lid. There is a thin metal latch that flips up nicely over and around the button so you don't have an accidental discharge of all your liquid inside your bag or on the floor. The bottle is touted as no leak because the flip-top lid has a silicon pad underneath which creates a seal on the ""spout"" when closed. In fact, the entire mouthpiece is covered, protecting it from the environment. Another useful gimmick added to the lid is a rotating dial on top which is there to help keep track of how many bottles you drink.Usability: First off, I've used many different hydration containers with all sorts of mouth pieces and I must say, I don't like putting my mouth on stuff when I drink out of it. The bite valve used on CamelBak's bottles and hydration pouches is pretty novel, but I not only have to put my mouth on it (leaving residue), but also bite into it, thereby grinding everything it is exposed to further into the valve and sucking up whatever is left. The squeeze bottles where the seal breaks when enough pressure is applied is okay, but they just aren't solid enough for me. Thermos finally has it right. The flip-top lid works exactly as it should. You press the button and it quickly snaps open and stays there, due to a small silicon band wrapped in a way that applies constant tension to the lid, but is easy to snap close with one finger. The mouthpiece is perfect for me because it is large (but not too large) enough for me to basically pour a steady stream of water into my mouth for quick hydration. The true test is when you aren't thinking about it like, say, when at the gym doing high intensity workouts. The mechanism was so smooth (open and close) that it did not interrupt or deter me one bit. As for the rotating dial, it takes more than you think to turn this thing. Being smooth plastic, you really must put some pressure on it to rotate it, even with the grooves. It is still functional to me.Overall, for my purposes, this is an excellent and unique design for a hydration bottle. Because there aren't many porous internal surfaces, you can put liquids other than water in there. But, not for long and you must rinse it out immediately afterwards, so I wouldn't recommend it. Just an FYI, if you do not care about the rotating dial, Thermos also makes a similar Under Armour version which has a slightly shorter lid and smaller thumb button. The bottle also seems to be made of slightly thicker plastic, so it maybe could survive harder crashes. I can't really say for sure. It is also slightly cheaper at $15.99 right now on Amazon, but only $12.99 in the PX for those in the military.",Positive,0,1,0,regular gym goer good amount perfect tool water bottles liter bottles gallon jug slender bottle bpa-free solid loop vice versa dual measurement scale fluid ounces liters scale fluid ounces plastic

25761,25761,Sporting Goods,"Thermos 24 Ounce Tritan Hydration Bottle with Meter, Teal",5,7-Dec-20,Canada,18.88,"Best water bottle ever, period.","Best water bottle for quick refills and quick sips.Pros:+Quick refill - You can easily refill it from the drinking opening, no need to unscrew lid! Though make sure you get any water out of the open lid, it's gonna drip on your hand when you close it (And still make sure to disassemble and wash regularly!)+Quick and safe sip - the rubberband-loaded lid opens with the push of a big, thumb-fitting button in a quick motion, and you can close it shut just as easily with your index finger. More importantly though, you don't need to touch any of the drinking beak with your hands. It should theoretically remain clean and protected under the dome that is the opening lid.+No leaks - The lid is well-adjusted enough that when you close it, it clicks shut, and there is a little rubber pad under the lid that acts as a sealing cap. With the metal ring lock on (preventing the button to open the lid), I found it to never leak in any circumstance (left loose in my backpack, bottom of a car, etc.). There is a good reason to use the lock in those times though, as the opening button is indeed very easy to push (and open the lid), if your bottle ever gets squeezed in some way at the wrong place.+Resistant! - That thing is made of some hard plastic. I've taken relatively good caution if it, that said, as I've never like, threw it on the ground, nor dropped too many times, but the transparent plastic that holds the water looks very solid, and a tiny bit flexible, so that a drop wouldn't break it. If anything I don't trust it's the lid. Feels like a high enough drop with a full bottle might break or at least crack it at its weakest point. Still pretty certain nothing would break from any drop if it's empty. It probably would if I throw it at hard ground with all my strength. But so would most anything I own. I had one for a year now, and the most it got was mild scratches.+Ergonomic - Not huge, but not small either. Holds a decent amount of water and feels pretty easy to hold in my very medium-sized hands. And again, holding it high--by the lid--makes it comfy to just hold, pop open, and close, all with a single hand.+Cheap - For the build quality, mechanism and overall ease that this bottle makes it to stay hydrated, the price is mooore than adequate. Don't be fooled by the price, this thing will serve you long, and well.Cons-Plastic - Obligatory reminder that despite all its pros, this is still plastic, and therefore is far from the cleanest approach to water storage. As opposed to metals or glass, plastic is porous on the microscopic scale and will tend to hold onto dirt and such stuff, which means its insides, constantly coveted in water, makes it an easy breeding ground for mold and stuff like it. It also has a tendency to deteriorate in the long term, making it even more porous. So all this means is: be wary of keeping water still for lomg periods in there. It's basic maintenance with anything plastic: keep it dry, or drink/empty it and wash it regularly. If you're a constant drinker like me, it shouldn't be an issue, though. I drink my bottle empty many times a day (always fresh water), and I wash it every week or so. Therefore I believe this bottle will crumble apart from old age and usage before it makes me sick.-Thermals - Should be obvious, but this water isn't made to retain heat, or any temperature a liquid is at. It will get cold if in a cold environment, and vice versa. It might be made by well-known brand of coffee containers THERMOS, but here they offer a simple water bottle. They also advise against using hot liquids in it. Its materials apparently aren't cut for it. Haven't tried it myself, but I wouldn't. I'd honestly expect the plastic to warp from boiled-water levels of heat.-Small sinks - This is a very medium-sized bottle in all respects. However it's still fairly ""long"", especially for smaller sinks. This bottle will probably fit any and all kitchen sink. But I'm a bit bummed that it doesn't fit my bathroom's. Most bathroom sinks are very small and won't fit this bottle to refill from either manner: pop-open lid or unscrewed lid. Barely a con as it's kinda unavoidable, but at least consider the fact. Definitely a tiny con for me >:cConclusion:I took this many words to write a review, because if you're like me and need to drink you water constantly, this thing is truly a life changer. It makes it easy, comfy, safe, handy, you name it. And it's cheap!! At 12 bucks, even if I take great care of it, my mind is still at ease if something ever happens to it.I use it mostly at home, it follows me everywhere around the house, a colorful reminder to take a refreshing sip. I also bring it along in the car, everywhere I go, be it work, groceries, etc. It's small enough to fit in probably any cup holder, and most importantly, as explained before, it's easy to grab and drink with one hand while driving, without ever leaving eyes from the road. I love it.One last thing, since I drink often, I used to have a dedicated glass of water near the sink that would eventually catch dirt from other residents activity, it would get caught in others' dishes and whatnot. Since it's just water, I don't need (nor want) to wash it after every use.

25922,25922,Toys,"ThinkFun 5000 Rush Hour Traffic Jam Logic Game, 58 Pieces",5,24-Jul-12,United Kingdom,27.98,your very own M25 in a bag,"Rush Hour has to be one of our best toy discoveries of the year - it's a portable puzzle game that has everyone who has played with it in this house from age 6-70 enthralled.The game consists of a plastic box with a 6x6 grid on it, 42 game cards and, as the name of the game would suggest a number of vehicles (4 trucks and 12 cars) that fit onto the grid and are the pieces you play with. Everything is compact - the grid is about 13.5cm by 16cm, and fits into a small drawstring bag, making the game very transportable and quick to set up. Game play is simple but engaging - in theory it's for one person to play at a time but we quite often find that one person will play and several more will get involved leading to co-operative puzzle solving and much discussion and scratching of heads.The basic idea is to use one of the cards to set up a traffic jam of trucks and cars, these being variously 2 or 3 squares long of the grid, and then to free the red car and let it ""drive"" out of the gap in the grid, a bit like the illustration on the packaging as seen above. The cards show in pictorial form how to lay out the cars and lorries horizontally and vertically. To make it easy the pieces are all totally different colours and made of a hollow, light, but robust plastic. Once you have the game is set up you move the vehicles forward and backwards, but in no other direction, as much as you want until you find the sequence to free the red car. It's a bit like tetris in reverse and instantly addictive.I like the fact that there is a little drawer in the grid to store the game cards and the game itself is expandable as you can buy more cards and special vehicles. We have just stuck the basic game so far, the cards come in three different challenge levels and have kept members of this house amused for hours. A card can take seconds or up to an hour to solve, it depends on the complexity of the card and the skill of the player. The solution is printed on the back if the jam becomes too much, when playing you really do have to think about how to work out the puzzle it's great fun but also can get quite frustrating as you wonder how a few pieces of plastic can have you so stumped!The set is pretty well made and well worth the purchase price in my opinion, it's definitely a great item to fill an ideal five minutes or the tricky time for children in a restaurant when colouring no longer appeals. I like the fact that it is so tactile - the game is available on i-Pad also but somehow in 2-D, though it is to all intents and purposes identical, is much less involving than having to physically push real pieces around a board.I'm not a huge board game fan in general but this game is great, and it's a real must-have for holidays. There is a junior version availableRush Hour Juniorbut this one is suitable for anyone aged 4 or above who will be able to access it in different ways, with the very youngest setting out and pushing around the cars and older players enjoying the very real challenge that such a fun looking game can provide. Highly recommended.",Positive,0,1,0,rush hour toy discoveries enthralled.the game plastic box game cards game basic idea traffic jam red car pictorial form different colours robust plastic red car game cards special vehicles basic

I set them aside and planned to return them rather disappointed.  But, I thought I'd give the manufacturer a call as I grew up with Crayola, as many did of course.I had to wait until Monday during business hours, but I was shocked at literally zero hold time.  The rep was easy to understand and incredibly polite and helpful.  She stated that she did know what it was and that is was safe.She said that it is called ""bloom"" and it is similar to when hard chocolate gets some white discoloration.  She stated that with the crayons, sometimes paraffin (wax) separates a little and comes to the surface. It comes out in the little dots to form the white milky powder, but it is just wax from the crayon that has separated and been drawn to the surface.It sounds quite believable to me, but feel free to judge for yourself.The crayons are perfect so far for my son, easy to hold and seemed like a normal but large crayon to me.  So I gave 5 stars since the disappointment was offset by fast and courteous customer support.I took a star off the ""giftable"" category though because it could be unsettling to receive as a gift and not know what was going on.",Neutral,1,0,0,white milky powder crayons crayola business hours zero hold time hard chocolate white discoloration white milky powder surface.it sounds yourself.the crayons large crayon courteous customer support.i

I've played metroidvanias before I always sort of ran out of steam after a while because the exploration aspect got a bit frustrating to me after a while. Somehow, the regular upgrades to abilities and the beautiful areas in the game always kept me excited about what would come next. The set of skills you earn gradually make Samus a formidable and nimble character that makes traversing the world a breeze. Moreover, by the end of the game I was regularly fighting fairly challenging enemies, but I found I could learn their moveset and react to them fluidly because of both the new abilities I had acquired and the way the game had made me learn how to use them. It's the sign of a very carefully constructed player progression arc that is very hard to get right.If I had to point out a flaw, it'd be that some of the moves are a little complicated to execute at speed. I would often find myself unable to execute a particular sequence of actions as I intended. Somehow my intuition about how the move should work and the dynamics of them in the game didn't always line up. I did manage to master this more or less over the game though and considering the breadth of skills I imagine it was difficult to map them all onto sensible controls. Besides these particular difficulties, Samus moves around very fluidly and is a joy to constrol.Finally, when you unlock enough abilities, the game becomes a sort of puzzle game based on the abilities you have. I would really recommend getting 100% of items to experience this element of the gameplay, because you could easily miss it. You will likely need a guide though as some of the capabilities of Samus aren't obvious, especially regarding the nuances of the speed boost.Getting all the items and completing the game took me about 15 hours. That might not sound a lot for the cost of the game, but it felt like the perfect amount of time for me when the credits rolled.",Positive,0,1,0,metroid dread metroid exploration aspect somehow regular upgrades beautiful areas samus nimble character challenging enemies new abilities player progression arc particular sequence somehow particular difficulties samus likely need samus perfect

26553,26553,Video Games,"Thrustmaster T16000M FCS Flight Pack - Joystick, Throttle and Rudder Pedals for PC",5,19-Jan-18,United Kingdom,,This is arguably the best product for any flight sim that I have ever had.,"So I bought this since I wanted some rudder pedals, and then I liked the idea of a separate throttle from the joystick, and I needed the joystick, so I bought the whole shebang.The joystick has single-device capability, meaning you don't require either the extra throttle or the pedals to be able to get full functionality. It has typical X and Y axis, as well as rotation for rudder, and a slider for throttle. It has 12 buttons in total, 6 each side of the base, and 3 on the top of the column with the POV switch. When I initially bought this I was looking into the possibility of using it left handed when flying airbus aircraft, and when it came I immediately saw the thumbrest on the left side of it, implying it wasn't ambidextrous. Upon further inspection of the box, it also comes with left-handed versions, or if you want to, it also comes with another non-rest cover, meaning it can be used without any rest for your thumb. This is very nice with flight simmjng because I'm used to an 8-bit input from my Saitek F.L.Y.5, which got grubby and the pots became very dirty, preventing it from working. That joystick also had a difficult spring, which was difficult because you'd either move too Mich or too little - with no in-between, meaning when flying some aircraft, I'd be rolling down the runway at takeoff speed, gently pull back and all of a sudden I'm nosed up 15°, with the stall siren active. With this joystick there's none of that - fluid motion, so much so that you can see the slight inputs that it makes when you're just holding the joystick in place - its not massively noticeable, but its like the natural sort of input you'd expect from the real aircraft.As for the separate throttle, it has 3 axis, a rocker switch, 3 hat switches and 3 buttons, as well as a controller joystick by your index finger. I'd prefer that by your thumb, however its easy to avoid accidentally moving it using your index finger, since the throttle is pretty big, even for my hands, which are quite big. The throttle movement is very fluid, however it's not adjustable in terms of friction. The other axis include a rocker-styled axis, its like a guard on a sword in terms of placement, and could be used for wheel steering or rudder - depending on whatever usage you want, and the last axis is on the far left of the throttle itself, almost like a trim wheel, however it is very limited in motion, possibly 90°. 2 buttons are also in weird places, one is likely to be hit with your pinky, and the other is likely to be hit with either middle or ring finger. The third button is just below the 3 hat switches. Out of the hat switches, the top is programmed as an actual had switch, whilst the other 2 have independent control, meaning they're more like d-pads in terms of programming.The rudder pedals were a bit weird to begin with, since I used to use steering wheel pedals to control myself when on the ground. This caused a little bit of a problem since I'm not moving my foot forwards or backwards like on rudder pedals, so I either keep braking or turning the wrong way! Again, the axis itself is not adjustable in friction, however it is still very fluid just like the rest of the set. The brakes are set via individual axis meaning you have 2 axis for brakes and then the rudder axis itself. Not much to say other than its very nice now being able to brake using the proper motion!Out of the whole set, I have it running in Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous and FSX/P3D and it works wonderfully in all of them. I very much enjoy being able to finally do away with having to move my hand constantly between either throttle or joystick onto the keyboard to be able to do certain things. Overall the plastic is very premium, and the joystick set as a whole feels solid, and so far has been worth every penny. I only wish that my Saitek Cessna proflight yoke/throttle was up to this standard.In terms of gripes, my only improvements I could put forward to Thrustnaster is to move the joystick ob the throttle to where your thumb is, and either put more buttons where the joystick is currently, or place another rocker switch there. I would then do away with the dedicated hat-switch since the joystick will replace it, and keep the other d-pad hat-switches there. I would then add more buttons behind the throttle (like where the screen is on the X52 joystick) and remove many of the buttons below on the base of the joystick since they are less likely to be used. At the top of the joystick column, I miss the rotating wheel on my F.L.Y.5 joystick, since I had used it for elevator trim. I'm not sure I would add friction adjustments capabilities to the throttle; however I would consider it on the pedals. The only other niggle is that the pedals I'd have thought would be USB with the throttle plugging into the joystick, and joystick plugging in via USB. The joystick and throttle plug in via USB, and an adapter can be bought for the pedals for it to plug in via USB. The pedals plug into the throttle, which is a very odd choice.I haven't attempted tightening any screws on the pedals so it could just be a loose screw, however the pedals to rotate ever so slightly, enough for me to hear 2-3 bumps if you get comfy in your seat with your feet resting on them.Other than the fact that some things are in what I'd call less than ideal places, I have had no problems. There are some minor niggles, but its nothing that has caused me frustration.",Positive,0,1,0,rudder pedals separate throttle whole shebang.the joystick single-device capability extra throttle full functionality pov airbus aircraft left side n't ambidextrous upon flight simmjng 8-bit input saitek f.l.y.5 difficult spring mich

Colors are so vibrant and I love how they match with each other (See photos attached).At first I thought, meh, it's like 50% more expensive but the shipping is free and there is no taxes applicable. (So the total is really 144$). Therefore, it's only like, 30$ more than a normal set (which would have cost 115$ taxes included).I only navigated throughout the console menu yet so cannot review about the actual use of it but everything seems normal. The only thing I noticed is it's more difficult to insert/remove from the console but maybe it's just because they are new and it will become smoother after some use.Also, super fast shipping!! Ordered last Thursday night, received them on Tuesday (with the free shipping option).Just go for it!Edit march 29: I've used them a few time now and they work great. I also wanted to precise that I used them in Canada so no problem with compatibility. 2 days shipping was from Ontario-Mississauga to Quebec-Montreal",Positive,0,1,0,okay usual colors colors normal set $ taxes console menu actual use super fast shipping ordered free shipping option edit canada days shipping ontario-mississauga quebec-montreal

Depends on preference,"This is my 3rd Razer mechanical keyboard. I had the original black widow and also have the v3 clicky at home. I bought this one for work since clicky keys would be too loud.The first thing I noticed with the yellow switches was just how sensitive they are to pressure. The clicky keys take some force to push down and that is a good and bad thing depending on your preference. My major problem was I tend to rest my fingers on the keys at work. This would cause random keys to be pressed. The solution is to just not rest your fingers. It took some getting used to but about a week in I saw less accidentally key activation. I think the yellow keys make you type faster but I still like my green keyboard since I know when the key is pressed.Adding to this point, I think razer should make a ""brown"" tactile but silent version of the black widow. I think the only one they offer is the compact version without the number and rest pads. I don't understand why they can't add that option to the full keyboard since they obviously designed and have the key in stock.If you are wondering how loud the keys are, that depends on how hard you hit the keys. I tend to push all the way down so even the yellow silent keys make some noise. But since they are linear, you can press halfway and they key will still activate.The razer mechanical keyboards are definitely the best imo. I've looked around but razer seems to be the only one that has the custom built wrist pad. I also like the scroll wheel and the build quality. A lot of the other mechanical keyboards have name brand cherry MX switches but then cheap out on the outer material or add weird stuff like a USB passthrough???",Positive,0,1,0,razer mechanical keyboard original black widow v3 clicky clicky keys yellow switches clicky keys bad thing major problem random keys key activation yellow keys green keyboard silent version black widow

The keyboard is heavy and solid, the keys are solid and has never missed a keystroke. Battery last the entire time I'm using it but if will not be typing for a while I do switch it to ""off"". It does charge over night and a very few times while gaming for extended amount of time had to connect it with the charging cable.The only complaint I have is the keyboard isn't much bigger then the area the keys take up. This really wouldn't be a problem for most people. My monitor is on a swing arm and I sit in a recliner, swing the monitor to in front of me and grab the keyboard and place it on my lap and when need to get up I swing the monitor out of the way and grab the keyboard to rest it on top of my computer... that's where my problem is with the keyboard... there isn't a lot to grab onto to move it around. I lower the leg next to the volume control and grab that along with the keyboard to give me something to grab onto when moving it to the top of the computer.Over all this is a 5 star keyboard and I would buy it again.",Neutral,1,0,0,oct light pattern n't work keys unlit battery entire time computer ... keyboard ... volume control star keyboard

Pero ya casi tengo un año usándolo y ahora no representa problema, que sean silenciosos es un plus.Deben de actualizar sí o sí el firmware del teclado, tuve durante mas de 1 mes el problema de que que algunas teclas se pulsaban dobles, pueden leer las reseñas de amazon que dicen eso, pero se soluciona actualizando el firmware, solo que no todos lo saben y razer tampoco te la pone tan fácil.La ruedita del volumen no funciona de forma exacta cuando haces movimientos leves, lo haces levemente para subir y el volumen baja (o viceversa), también lo mencionan en las reseñas, no siempre sucede pero la verdad es que por el precio estas cosas no deberían suceder nunca. También es cierto que casi nunca uso la ruedita.Finalmente, el reposamuñecas no tiene imán, solamente se coloca ""junto al teclado"". Pero insisto, por el precio debería estar imantado para que no se mueva facilmente (aunque la verdad no se mueve con facilidad). Otra cosa del reposamuñecas es que la tela se empezó a despegar un poco, no es nada grave pero ya no se ve igual de bonito que al principio.Por todo esto creo que el precio de este teclado debería ser por mucho de USD 150.

That is why I never bought the other options, if I'm getting up to press the change button it's 3/4 the work of doing the actual gamecard change. This makes it much more convenient by having the remote.I've played several games running out of this and from my hours of playtime and I cant say I noticed any lag or anything that would lead me to believe this slows down how fast the Switch can read the cards or anything, it seems to cause no quality loss at all.My only suggestion for the designers would be to have a remote with 1 button for each game slot. The way the switch handles gamechanges it moves your most recently inserted gamecard to the left. If you want to switch from game1 to game4 it is going to spam your homescreen's ordering to also include game2 and game3 because they were temporarily activated as you progressed to your target game4.",Positive,0,1,0,i 'm did.the unit clips jumper cable gamecard slot gamecard 's cheap door nintendo i 've close.it 's 4game switcher change button actual gamecard remote.i 've switch quality loss game

With digital this is not an issue, but with this device you can switch between 8 carts without getting up to switch the cart out physically. It even includes a small remote, which I have chosen to keep on my side table.I believe there is a larger version available for more carts, but I think 8 is very reasonable for most switch games.

I am relatively new to the switch gaming system and this makes things easier. We hung it on the back of the base station dock and plugged into one of the USB ports. Places the 4 most used games in and got to playing. I really like the remote controller to switch between games. Very easy to use and my 7 yr old granddaughter figured it out easily. This helps eliminate damage to the cards that can occur with repreated insert/removal from switch unit; especially with young kids. Also, this stores 4 in the active slots and an additional 4 in the storage slots. I would and have told my friends and family members that have the switch gaming system about this unit.",Positive,0,1,0,base station dock usb places remote controller old granddaughter switch unit young kids active slots storage slots family members

It's neat to be able to have 4 games to swap between at one time, but also, if you ever want to take the Switch portably it's not exactly something that travels well with it. The 4 cart slots seem decent at holding the games and I had no issues with changing games via the button or included remote. The 4 additional cart storage slots are VERY large compared to the carts and they could easily fall out of it.Here's how it works, you place up to 4 games in the slot on the front and you can press the button on the unit itself, or on the included remote to change between the games. No the Switch can not see all 4 games at the same time. It sees whatever game the changer has selected currently. If you keep your Switch docked this might help with wear and tear on your Switch's cart slot.A personal issue I have is that my Switch is wall mounted so you can't hang the cart changer on it because it hangs on the back. So if you have one of those, know that you'll likely have to let it sit on top of the unit.It's a good idea but with poor implimentation for anyone who doesn't use the switch exclusively docked. Or maybe if you play different games portably than you do when it's docked. Otherwise you need to remove the game from the game changer and put it directly into the Switch any time you plan to play on the go.The MSRP (39.99 at time of review) seems high, but okay for such a unique device and if you have a use case for it I can see it being a godsend, but for me I don't really need it. It is a fun unique thing to use but I doubt it'll stay in use for long in my house.",Positive,0,1,0,'s neat switch cart slots additional cart storage slots very it.here 's switch switch switch 's cart slot.a personal issue switch ca n't cart changer unit.it 's good idea poor

You can switch games and everything works as expected. As long as you mostly use your Switch in this way, it's a nice product.However, since the clips are designed with the official dock in mind, the design isn't really flexible enough that it can sit comfortably anywhere if you use a third-party dock. It's also not really viable to use in portable mode at all, since you need USB power.

Since I didn't have my phone handy (and otherwise dislike reading instructions from my phone), it took a second to get this installed and oriented correctly.  It is by no means a difficult installation, but I wanted to keep everything clean and the cords managed.Once installed, it works exactly as expected.  You can have up to five of your favorite games cartridges installed and easily switch between them with just a tap of the remote.  You can also store five additional cartridges to quickly swap into a game slot.  No more fiddling with the Switch's cartridge cover which always feels like it is just about to break.If there is anything I would prefer differently about this reader, it's that I'd probably like if the cartridges faced forward, rather than toward the back.  This would make them a bit more accessible when swapping out games.  For me, with that change, this would be five stars for sure but other than that, it is a very handy device to have to conveniently and quickly switch between games.",Neutral,1,0,0,switch card reader qr code link dislike reading instructions difficult installation cords managed.once favorite games cartridges additional cartridges game slot switch 's cartridge handy device
